# Wavesurfer React
This repository is a homepage of wavesurfer-react package, that is built upon [wavesurfer.js](https://wavesurfer-js.org).


# Why?
This package is intended to be an abstraction over wavesurfer.js and as much close to react style of doing things as its maintainer can provide.

# Demo
